# Welcome to the code home of [Courageous Engineer](https://www.courageousengineer.com)!
#### Courageous Engineer is a platform for people to share their experiences in the engineering field which required courage.
#### From social biases to doing the right thing when there is opposition, many of us have had situations that required courage.
#### Our hope is that sharing these experiences will help others facing these difficult situations in the engineering world.
## Background
I built the original version of this site as a Christmas gift to my wife, [Yolanda Smit](https://www.twitter.com/@yoyosmit). 
It started life as a basic Flask app that had to persistence (the articles and data were stored in a dictionary). 
Over time I have worked to create a CMS that she could use to easily add content herself. 
## Next Steps
- Improve design and asthetic throughout site (carry engineering theme throughout)
- Improve user workflow to make any potential onboarding of contributors (code or writing) easier
    - Proper CI/CD for pull requests into the main branch
    - Proper user workflow for content contributors
    - Issue and pull request templates to improve feedback consistency
- Continue to create content that adds value to the community
